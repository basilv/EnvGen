<h1>EnvGen - Environment-Specific File Generator</h1>

<p><a href="#Overview">Overview</a> | <a href="#UsersManual">User's Manual</a> | <a href="#ChangeHistory">Change History</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>EnvGen is an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>
task for generating different versions of the same file parameterized for
different environments (i.e. development, test, and
production). File generation is done using <a href="http://freemarker.org/">FreeMarker</a>,
a template engine with a full-featured templating
language. </p>

<p>You specify environment-specific properties in a CSV
file
(comma separated value spreadsheet). EnvGen functions similar
to Ant's Copy task: you run EnvGen against one or more source filesets
into a target directory. Rather than simply copying each file over,
EnvGen generates a version of the target file for each environment
specified in the properties CSV file. Usually the target directory or
filename is parameterized by environment so that EnvGen writes each
version to a different physical file. </p>

<h3>Why Use EnvGen?</h3>

<p>EnvGen is most useful when the technology being used does not
allow
environment differences to be parameterized. Frequent examples of this
that I have come across are database tablespace or other storage
settings in DDL, and mainframe code where namespaces are typically used
to provide separate environments. While EnvGen is a surprisingly
powerful tool, I recommend only using it when you absolutely
need to. Generation adds an extra level of abstaction and complexity
that is best avoided if possible. Most code can be parameterized for
environmental differences without resorting to generation.</p>

<p>EnvGen is essentially an Ant task that wraps the FreeMarker
template engine. While FreeMarker is a great template engine,
I found it difficult to use directly because it does not provide any
useful Ant tasks. The FreeMarker community has addressed this by
creating <a href="http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/">FMPP</a>,
a wrapper for FreeMarker that makes it easier to use and includes an
Ant task. The main different between FMPP and EnvGen is that FMPP is a
general-purpose text file preprocessor tool with a broad set of
features, while EnvGen is focused entirely on environment-specific file
generation and makes this single task much easier to do than
FMPP.</p>

using EnvGen and is referenced within this manual.</p>

<p>The <a href="#AdvancedTopics">last section</a>
of this manual covers&nbsp;more <a href="#AdvancedTopics">advanced
topics</a> regarding the use of EnvGen. </p>

<h3><a name="InstallEnvGen">Installing EnvGen</a></h3>

<p>
To install EnvGen simply unzip the <code>EnvGen-1.X.zip</code>
file into an appropriate directory. The contents of the zip file will
be contained within a root directory <code>EnvGen-1.X</code>.
</p>

<p>The contents of an EnvGen release (zip file) includes the
following files and directories:
</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>EnvGen-with-dependencies.jar</code> - Jar
file containing EnvGen class files plus all dependent libraries.</li>

  <li><a href="dependencies-list.txt"><code>dependencies-list.txt</code></a>
- Text file listing the dependent libraries and their versions used to
develop and test EnvGen. These libraries are included in the <code>EnvGen-with-dependencies.jar</code>
file.</li>

  <li><code>EnvGen.jar</code> - Jar file containing
only EnvGen class files. Use this jar when you want to use a different
version of one of the dependent libraries.</li>

  <li><a href="example"><code>/example</code></a>
- This directory contains a simple example of how to use EnvGen which
is referenced in this manual.</li>

  <li><a href="src"><code>/src</code></a>
- Source code for EnvGen.</li>

  <li><a href="javadoc/index.html">API Documentation</a>
- JavaDoc API documentation for EnvGen.</li>

  <li><a href="build/build.xml"><code>/build/build.xml</code></a>
- Ant build file for EnvGen.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="DefineEnvGenTask">Defining the EnvGen task</a></h3>

<p>
To use the EnvGen Ant task as part of an Ant build, it must first be
defined within that build file. The easiest way to do this is to use <code>&lt;taskdef&gt;</code>
and specify the <code>EnvGen-with-dependencies.jar</code>
jar file for the classpath as per the following excerpt taken from the
example <a href="example/build.xml"><code>build.xml</code></a>:
</p>

<pre>&lt;taskdef name="envgen"<br> classname="com.basilv.envgen.EnvGenTask"<br> classpath="${envgen.dir}/EnvGen-with-dependencies.jar"<br>/&gt;<br></pre>

<p>If you want to use a different version of one of the dependent
libraries such as FreeMarker, then you can specify a classpath that
includes <code>EnvGen.jar</code> plus the desired versions
of all the required libraries.
</p>

<h3><a name="CreateEnvPropertiesFile">Creating the Environment Properties File</a></h3>

<p>
Environment-specific settings are specified in an environment
properties file which is a CSV-formatted spreadsheet. Each row
corresponds to a single property or a comment. For a property, the
first column contains the name of
the property. Each subsequent column contains the value of the property
for a single environment. A row whose first column is empty or contains
text starting with '#' or '//' is considered to be a comment
which causes that line to be ignored.
</p>

<p>The example environment properties file <a href="example/envProperties.csv"><code>envProperties.csv</code></a>
is listed below (without the comments).
It defines three properties named "env", "server", and "database" for
three environments.
</p>

<table class="fancy" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>env</td>
      <td>devl</td>
      <td>test</td>
      <td>prod</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server</td>
      <td>intel-010-d</td>
      <td>intel-021-t</td>
      <td>intel-025-p</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>database</td>
      <td>app-d1</td>
      <td>app-t1</td>
      <td>app-p1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h3><a name="CreateTemplateFile">Creating the Template File(s)</a></h3>

<p>
You must create one or more template files to supply to EnvGen to use
as the basis for generating the environment-specific files based on the
properties you defined in the environment properties file. The template
files can be any type of text file.
Since EnvGen uses <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforget.net">FreeMarker</a>
as the template engine, you need to use the <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html">FreeMarker
Template Language</a> within each template file to specify
property substitutions or to use more advanced logic.
</p>

<p>Most commonly you will want to substitute properties defined
in the environment properties file into the template file.
This is done using the syntax <code>${&lt;propertyname&gt;}</code>. For
example, given the "env" property defined in the example environment
property file above,
a line in the template file consisting of <code>"Environment =
${env}"</code> will be transformed into the output <code>"Environment
= devl"</code> for the first environment.
</p>

<p>See the example template file <code>environment-summary.txt.ftl</code>.
The contents of this file are reproduced below:
</p>

<pre>
Summary for Environment "${env}"
------------------------------

Build number ${buildNumber}

&lt;#if env="devl"&gt;
This is development!
&lt;/#if&gt;

Server: ${server}
Database: ${database}
</pre>

<h3><a name="InvokeEnvGen">Invoking the EnvGen Task</a></h3>

<p>EnvGen is invoked from within an Ant build like any other Ant
task. This section describes how to invoke EnvGen as an Ant task.
</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<p>The attributes supported by the EnvGen task are:</p>

<table class="fancy" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>envPropertiesFile</td>
      <td>The CSV file containing the environment-specific
properties.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>destDir</td>
      <td>The destination directory to write the generated files
to. This directory can be parameterized in which case the actual
directory path will be generated for each environment. </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>stripFileExtension</td>
      <td>Strip the right-most file extension (from the last
period right) from the generated filename. For example "test.txt.ftl"
would be changed to "test.txt". </td>
      <td>No; defaults to false</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>overwrite</td>
      <td>Overwrite existing files even if the destination file is up to date. even if the destination files
are newer than both the source file and the environment properties
file. </td>
      <td>No; defaults to false</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>diffToUpdate</td>
      <td>By default (<code>overwrite = "false"</code> and <code>diffToUpdate = "false"</code>),
each destination file is only generated if it is older than either the
source file or the environment properties file. When
diffToUpdate&nbsp;is set to true, then the generation is done and the
destination file is updated only if the generated content is different
from the existing content. This is useful when the FreeMarker <code>&lt;#include&gt;</code>
directive is used since a change to an included file will
not&nbsp;trigger a regeneration if the source file was not changed. The
content comparison ignores differences in line endings, in case the <code>&lt;fixcrlf&gt;</code> task is executed against EnvGen's output.</td>
      <td>No; defaults to false</td>
    </tr>
  
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Parameter Specified as Nested Elements</h4>

<p>The nested elements supported by the EnvGen task are:</p>

<h5>Source</h5>

<p>
Each <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> is an implicit
fileset used to select groups of files to generate.
</p>

<h5>Transform</h5>

<p>
Transforms are a feature of FreeMarker that allow for the programmatic
transformation of a block within a template file. A transform is
implemented as a Java class and must be registered with the FreeMarker
engine via this element.
The <code>&lt;transform&gt;</code> element has the
following attributes:
</p>

<table class="fancy" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>The name of the variable storing the transform, used
within the template file to invoke it. The name must correspond to a
java identifier: in particular, it cannot contain periods or dashes. </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>class</td>
      <td>The name of the transform class. This class must be
accessible on the classpath.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>EnvGen comes with the following built-in templates:</p>

<table class="fancy" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Template Class</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>com.basilv.envgen.MainframeFileFormatTransform</code></td>
      <td>Transforms input into a format acceptable for
mainframes. Tabs are converted to 4 spaces. Whitespace is trimmed from
the end of lines. The transform will fail with an error message if any
line is longer than 75 characters. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>com.basilv.envgen.SkipGenerationTransform</code></td>
      <td>Skips the generation of the target file, deleting it if it previously existed.
This is useful when you are generating multiple files for multiple environments and certain files are 
not needed in certain environments. This transform is only useful within conditional logic like 
FreeMarker's <code>&lt;#if&gt;</code> directive in order to allow the file to still be generated for certain environments.</td>
    </tr>
  
  </tbody>
</table>

<h5>SharedVariable</h5>

<p>
Shared variables are a feature of FreeMarker that allow for a variable
to be defined once up front and be available for use within all
template files.
The <code>&lt;sharedVariable&gt;</code> element
has the following attributes:
</p>

<table class="fancy" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>The name of the variable, used within the template file
to access it. The name must correspond to a java identifier: in
particular, it cannot contain periods or dashes. </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>value</td>
      <td>The value of the variable.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>The sample invocation below is taken from the example <a href="example/build.xml"><code>build.xml</code></a>
provided as part of the release.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;envgen destdir="${dist.dir}/$${env}"
	envPropertiesFile="envProperties.csv"
	overwrite="false"
	stripFileExtension="true"
&gt;
	&lt;source dir="${source.dir}"/&gt;
	&lt;transform name="mainframeFileFormat" class="com.basilv.envgen.MainframeFileFormatTransform"/&gt;
	&lt;sharedVariable name="buildNumber" value="100"/&gt;
&lt;/envgen&gt;
</pre>

This generates files from the <code>${source.dir}</code>
directory for each environment specified in the <code>envProperties.csv</code>
file and puts them in the target directory based on the environment
property <code>env</code>. If the ant property <code>${dist.dir}</code>
is set to <code>/dist</code>
and the environment properties file specifies one value of <code>env</code>
as <code>devl</code>, then the target directory for this
environment would be <code>/dist/devl</code>.

<h3><a name="AdvancedTopics">Advanced Topics</a></h3>

<p>
This section covers more advanced topics when using EnvGen.
</p>

<h4>Using FreeMarker's &lt;#include&gt; Directive</h4>

<p>
When using FreeMarker's <code>&lt;#include&gt;</code>
directive, the path
you specify to the file must be relative to the base directory of the
fileset the file is in. For an example, consider the following
directory structure:
</p>

<pre>/src<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;common.txt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;/resources<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;common-resources.txt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;properties.txt.ftl<br></pre>

<p>
EnvGen is run against the root <code>/src</code>
directory. The <code>properties.txt.ftl</code> file can
include <code>common.txt</code> and <code>common-resources.txt</code>
via the following include directives:
</p>

<pre>&lt;#include "common.txt"&gt;<br>&lt;#include "resources/common-resources.txt"&gt;<br></pre>

<p>
One limitation of EnvGen when using <code>&lt;#include&gt;</code>
is that EnvGen will not rebuild target files when only included files
are modified. For the above example, if only <code>common.txt</code>
is changed, then EnvGen will not regenerate <code>properties.txt</code>.
There are several workarounds for this limitation. The easiest workaround is to set the attribute <code>diffToUpdate = "true"</code>,
which will not rely on timestamps to determine whether to regenerate,
but instead do the generation and then only update the target file if
the generated content has changed. Other workarounds include using
Ant's <code>&lt;dependset&gt;</code> task, a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TouchFile.html">touch file</a>, or to set <code>override = "true"</code>.
